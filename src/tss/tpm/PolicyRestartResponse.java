* This command allows a policy authorization session to be returned to its initial state. This command is used after the TPM returns TPM_RC_PCR_CHANGED. That response code indicates that a policy will fail because the PCR have changed after TPM2_PolicyPCR() was executed. Restarting the session allows the authorizations to be replayed because the session restarts with the same nonceTPM. If the PCR are valid for the policy, the policy may then succeed.
